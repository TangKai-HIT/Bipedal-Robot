  abstract = {Research on humanoid robotic systems involves a considerable amount of computational resources, not only for the involved design but also for its development and subsequent implementation. For robotic systems to be implemented in real-world scenarios, in several situations, it is preferred to develop and test them under controlled environments in order to reduce the risk of errors and unexpected behavior. In this regard, a more accessible and efficient alternative is to implement the environment using robotic simulation tools. This paper presents a quantitative comparison of Gazebo, Webots, and V-REP, three simulators widely used by the research community to develop robotic systems. To compare the performance of these three simulators, elements such as CPU, memory footprint, and disk access are used to measure and compare them to each other. In order to measure the use of resources, each simulator executes 20 times a robotic scenario composed by a NAO robot that must navigate to a goal position avoiding a specific obstacle. In general terms, our results show that Webots is the simulator with the lowest use of resources, followed by V-REP, which has advantages over Gazebo, mainly because of the CPU use.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new method of a biped walking pattern generation by using a preview control of the zero-moment point (ZMP). First, the dynamics of a biped robot is modeled as a running cart on a table which gives a convenient representation to treat ZMP. After reviewing conventional methods of ZMP based pattern generation, we formalize the problem as the design of a ZMP tracking servo controller. It is shown that we can realize such controller by adopting the preview control theory that uses the future reference. It is also shown that a preview controller can be used to compensate the ZMP error caused by the difference between a simple model and the precise multibody model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a simulation of walking on spiral stairs.},

These characterizations, weak stability and strong stability (and their complements), arise naturally from the dynamic model of the system, formulated as a complementarity problem. Using the tools of complementarity theory, these characterizations are studied in detail to understand their properties and to develop techniques to identify the stability classifications of general systems subjected to known external loads.},

  abstract = {Validating robotics projects is a hard task. It demands more than intellectual effort, but also specific hardware usage, turning the designed project expensive and because of that, unviable to be executed. This process can be improved by the use of 3D simulators, which have been developed directed to scenarios such as architecture, games and virtual reality experiences, and can also be applied to robotics. There are available many 3D simulator options in the market, paid or free. Considering the 3D simulator options, a robotics project designer may have questions on how to choose the best suitable one. From that, this paper intends to analyze these software focusing on robotics simulation, proposing to clarify some questions and guide the simulator choice. After a literature review made in two stages (a more general search regarding 3D simulators and then the final choice considering abstract and conclusion), it was possible to choose the three most used ones by the robotic community: V-Rep, Gazebo, and Unity. We made a more in-depth study about them in order to evaluate and describe important features related to robotics. Later, we also did experiments using each tool intending to analyze terms relative to usability. The experiment consisted of replicating the same standard 3D scene in the three software. Based on the literature review and the experiments, it became possible to punctuate some observations. In terms of usability, V-Rep and Unity presented a significant degree of freedom considering scene editing, besides both having a friendly interface, while Gazebo showed to be more limited and it has a poor user interface. In the three simulators it is possible to perform a connection with ROS, but with different complexities, being Gazebo and V-Rep the easiest ones. They both have more features and facilities when considering developing a robotics project, leaving Unity behind.},
